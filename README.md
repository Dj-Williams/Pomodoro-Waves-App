# Pomodoro Waves App
Welcome to my app! I'm gonna get you focused man!

The idea behind this app was to make a Pomodoro-focused based productivity app, but it would allow the user to create and share playlists with other users. During the development process, it turned into just users sharing playlists(Waves) between each other. 

#Technology/Libraries Used:
* Javascript
* Bootstrap.css

_THE STACK!_

* MongoDB
* Mongoose 
* Express 
* Handlebars
* Node.js

I am proud to present my [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/aS5MBBQe/wdi-project-2-the-zone-app) for this for this project/app, and I feel like I unlocked a new level of organization and focus. (Even though I totally built this app backwards! üò´) 

My Stretch Goals are highlighted in gold and my Super Stretch Goals/Version 2 objectives are in orange. I wasn't able to achieve any of them this time around, but I'm glad that they're more attainable items than the last project.
